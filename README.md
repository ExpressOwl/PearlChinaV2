# Pearl China Takeaway Menu
Client wanted an updated website for their local business.
https://www.pearlchina.co.uk/

## Search Engine Optimization
Managed to get the site to the 1st page of Google when searched, even amongst other businesses with the same or similar name.

* Mobile responsiveness: It was made mobile first but is fully responsive to most screen sizes bar super wide screens. Websites that are optimized for mobile devices tend to rank higher in search results.

* Page load speed: Fast-loading web pages are preferred by search engines and provide a better user experience. Optimizing images, minimizing code, and using caching techniques can improve page load speed. It helps that the site is mostly HTML anyway...

* URL structure: Using descriptive and user-friendly URLs can improve SEO. Clear URLs that reflect the content hierarchy and keywords can make it easier for search engines to understand and rank your pages.

# Miscellaneous
Flowbite UI components were used, which is a part of Tailwind CSS.

The site is hosted using Vercel via Cloudflare and obtains around 1000 visitors a week.
